# DID-schema — working context for Claude

## READ THESE BEFORE answering about V_eta class structure or the migration walkthrough
The conversation gets compacted and loses fine-grained state. The durable record
lives in these files — read them instead of re-deriving from memory:

- **`schemas/V_eta_final_class_set.md`** — the authoritative persist set (7
  categories). REGENERATE with `python3 tools/regen_final_class_set.py` (reads the
  built `V_eta/index.json` disposition markers) after every `build_v_eta.py`; never
  hand-edit. NOTE: its counts are only as good as the `disposition` markers in
  build_v_eta.py (`_RET_SOURCES`/`_RET_CARRIERS`/`_IN_PROGRESS`) — dissolved source
  classes not listed there (treatment-family, image_stack, subject_group) still show
  as `persist`; fix the markers, not the doc. Category order is fixed:
  ① spine → ② entities → ③ **composites (data_type)** → ④ leaf tier →
  ⑤ time_reference → ⑥ **data_body (EXACTLY 2: sampled_body, opaque_body)** → ⑦ infra.
- **`schemas/V_eta_6_7_walkthrough_STATE.md`** — the ⑥/⑦ (infra) walkthrough with
  per-chunk (a–e) status. Update the status table as chunks land.
- **`schemas/V_eta_nonsubject_cohesiveness_plan.md`** — decisions D-A…D-F.
- **`schemas/V_eta_go_forward_class_audit.md`** — per-class dispositions.
- The live task list (TaskList) — the remaining chunks/tracks; it survives
  compaction. Keep it current: mark chunks in_progress/completed as you go.

## Hard-won facts (do not re-litigate)
- `data_body` has EXACTLY two members: `sampled_body`, `opaque_body`. Every
  format/series carrier (`timeseries_data*`, `dataseries_data`, `zarr`,
  `ephys_zarr`, `image_zarr`, `image`, `generic_file`, `pyraview`, …) PHASES OUT
  into those two (encoding becomes a field). Never list them under data_body.
- `zarr` is a storage format (⊂ base), NOT a quantity composite.
- Composites (③) list BEFORE leaves (④). The user has asked for this repeatedly.
- must_refer is DECLARATIVE (existence-only validation), not type-checked.
- Corpus gate: 0 quarantine + 0 orphans; per-class counts shift as classes
  dissolve, total-doc counts are the invariant. Soph needs DID_RUN_SOPH_TEST=1.
- V1 SOURCE UNIVERSE = 102 (NOT 87, NOT 91). Two writers: (A) NDI production
  templates = **91 on NDI-matlab origin/main** — `tools/coverage.py` reads them from
  `origin/main` via git, NOT the working tree, because the V_eta NDI feature branch
  lags main and silently drops classes main added after the fork (ensemble,
  kilosort_clusters, kiasort_clusters, daqreader_image_epochdata_ingested — the
  first 3 still have NO V_eta home, task #21). (B) vhlab app/calculator classes with
  no NDI template = 11 (contrast_tuning, the 3 other `*_tuning`, 7 `*_calc`), footprint
  = a bespoke migrator consuming them. Do NOT add post-v1 DID intermediate/target
  classes (zarr, directory, `*_observation`, data_body, openminds_import) to the v1
  side — provenance `origin` (`V_eta_class_provenance.md`) is the arbiter; only
  `did_v1`-origin (+ the 11 app classes) are sources. `coverage.py` also flags GAPS
  (no V_eta home + no migrator + absent from the V_zeta base = never reviewed):
  currently `ensemble`, `kilosort_clusters`, `kiasort_clusters` (task #21).
  `V_eta_coverage_ledger.md` AND `.json` are generated — re-run
  `python3 tools/coverage.py` after schema/migrator changes. The web viewer's
  **Coverage ledger** panel (`web/src/Coverage.tsx`) renders the `.json`
  (sync-schemas copies it to `public/coverage.json`).
- CALCULATORS ARE DEFERRED. Do NOT register `_calc` decomposition migrators
  (`<x>_calc.m` that split a calc doc into observations). The corpus stores calc
  outputs as `<x>_calc` docs that DOWNSTREAM calcs reference (e.g.
  `contrast_sensitivity_calc.contrasttuning_id_* -> contrast_tuning_calc`).
  Decomposing a `_calc` doc changes/removes its id, so every downstream reference
  DANGLES -> orphans (Soph went red with 11448 such orphans, 5445377). Passthrough
  of `_calc` docs validates against the RETAINED `_calc` schemas and keeps refs
  intact — that is the deferred-calculator green state. Un-defer only when the
  downstream calc CONSUMERS are migrated in the same pass.
- distance_metadata ~2078 JH quarantines ("required `endpoints` missing"): ROOT
  CAUSE (confirmed from the writer NDI-matlab `+setup/+conv/+haley/doImport.m` and
  the v1 template `ndi_common/database_documents/element/distance_metadata.json`):
  the v1 doc is FLAT — `ontologyNode_A/_B`, `integerIDs_A/_B`,
  `ontologyNumericValues_A/_B`, `ontologyStringValues_A/_B`, `units` — with NO nested
  `endpoints` and the numeric values genuinely `[]` (the distance lives in the
  associated `distance` timeseries ELEMENT, not the metadata doc). The migrator was
  written against an ASSUMED nested `endpoints.numeric_values` that does not exist in
  real docs → it always hits the no-vals passthrough → the flat doc fails the V_eta
  schema's required nested `endpoints` → quarantine. So the migrator NEVER worked on
  real corpus docs (its unit test used a wrong-shaped fixture). CORRECT FIX (NOT a
  casing tweak — a first camelCase attempt was WRONG and was reverted): map the flat
  A/B fields into the V_eta `endpoints` shape (integer_ids ← integerIDs_A/_B,
  string_ids ← ontologyStringValues_A/_B, node ← ontologyNode_A/_B) so it validates;
  the numeric distance is empty, so it CANNOT be a length_observation from the metadata
  doc alone. Part A (mint a measured_distance_to relation between the endpoint doc ids)
  was TRIED and REVERTED — the endpoint ids do NOT resolve in JH (4156 orphans = 2078×2,
  both endpoints dangle; the JH animal is likely an openminds_subject minting a NEW id,
  so the stored ontologyNode_A/_B are pre-migration ids), and it turned a non-gating
  quarantine into a GATING orphan failure. A single-doc migrator CANNOT mint a
  resolvable endpoint relation. DECISION: the correct rep is the NDI SECOND PASS
  (TaskList #18), which sees the migrated-id graph —
  decompose the distance timeseries ELEMENT into a length_observation of the
  graph-resolved animal subject (endpoint A), patch (endpoint B) as a spatial relation,
  consuming distance_metadata for the endpoint identities. The single-doc DID migrator
  lacks the element→subject graph + the timeseries values, so it CANNOT do this; it is
  left as-is (quarantine). Optional DID interim to clear the quarantines early: mint a
  directed_relation between the two endpoint DOC IDS (both resolve in-batch). Corpus is
  GREEN with these quarantines (JH's test does not gate quarantine) — data-completeness
  follow-up, not a gate.
- General migrator lesson: any NESTED sub-field a migrator reads needs a
  snake+camelCase fallback. AUDIT (this session) of every +migrators_j nested read:
  live nested multi-word reads were `syncrule_mapping.epochnode_*` (fixed) and
  `ontology_table_row.row.numeric_value` (defer WITH the D10/D11 redesign). Everything
  else reads BLOCK-level fields (snake-cased by universalRenames, safe) or PascalCase-
  by-design (metadata_editor's metadata_structure). NOTE distance_metadata is NOT a
  casing bug (see above) — it is a wrong-assumed-shape bug.

## Build / test
- `python3 tools/build_v_eta.py` rebuilds `schemas/V_eta/` (copytree V_zeta→V_eta
  then transforms). `python3 -m pytest tests/test_veta.py -q` checks the schema.
- Migrators live in DID-matlab `+did2/+convert/+migrators_j/`; corpus validation is
  DID-matlab `test-code.yml` (full, ~1–2h) and `test-migrators-quick.yml` (~2 min).
