# DID-schema — working context for Claude

## READ THESE BEFORE answering about V_eta class structure or the migration walkthrough
The conversation gets compacted and loses fine-grained state. The durable record
lives in these files — read them instead of re-deriving from memory:

- **`schemas/V_eta_final_class_set.md`** — the authoritative persist set (7
  categories). REGENERATE it from the built schema (the script that wrote it),
  never hand-edit from memory. Category order is fixed:
  ① spine → ② entities → ③ **composites (data_type)** → ④ leaf tier →
  ⑤ time_reference → ⑥ **data_body (EXACTLY 2: sampled_body, opaque_body)** → ⑦ infra.
- **`schemas/V_eta_6_7_walkthrough_STATE.md`** — the ⑥/⑦ (infra) walkthrough with
  per-chunk (a–e) status. Update the status table as chunks land.
- **`schemas/V_eta_nonsubject_cohesiveness_plan.md`** — decisions D-A…D-F.
- **`schemas/V_eta_go_forward_class_audit.md`** — per-class dispositions.
- The live task list (TaskList) — the remaining chunks/tracks; it survives
  compaction. Keep it current: mark chunks in_progress/completed as you go.

## Hard-won facts (do not re-litigate)
- `data_body` has EXACTLY two members: `sampled_body`, `opaque_body`. Every
  format/series carrier (`timeseries_data*`, `dataseries_data`, `zarr`,
  `ephys_zarr`, `image_zarr`, `image`, `generic_file`, `pyraview`, …) PHASES OUT
  into those two (encoding becomes a field). Never list them under data_body.
- `zarr` is a storage format (⊂ base), NOT a quantity composite.
- Composites (③) list BEFORE leaves (④). The user has asked for this repeatedly.
- must_refer is DECLARATIVE (existence-only validation), not type-checked.
- Corpus gate: 0 quarantine + 0 orphans; per-class counts shift as classes
  dissolve, total-doc counts are the invariant. Soph needs DID_RUN_SOPH_TEST=1.

## Build / test
- `python3 tools/build_v_eta.py` rebuilds `schemas/V_eta/` (copytree V_zeta→V_eta
  then transforms). `python3 -m pytest tests/test_veta.py -q` checks the schema.
- Migrators live in DID-matlab `+did2/+convert/+migrators_j/`; corpus validation is
  DID-matlab `test-code.yml` (full, ~1–2h) and `test-migrators-quick.yml` (~2 min).
