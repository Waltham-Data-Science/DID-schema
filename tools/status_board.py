"""Generate schemas/V_eta_STATUS.md -- the single generated record of V_eta state.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
V_eta state lives in 27 plan documents, a 400-line CLAUDE.md and a 52-item task
list, and no two agree. Prose cannot be checked, so it rots and is then cited:
"no session document exists anywhere", "all 0-usage, safe to delete",
"dissolved (rename/decompose)" -- each was a written claim that was wrong and
that nothing could catch.

This file replaces PROSE STATE with DERIVED STATE. The plan documents keep the
rationale (why a model was chosen -- what prose is genuinely good for); this
board owns the answer to "how much is left, and what exactly".

THE ONE PIECE OF JUDGEMENT, MADE EXPLICIT
-----------------------------------------
`FAMILIES` below groups the still-open classes into decision units. That mapping
is a human call and cannot be derived, so it is written here in the open rather
than implied across a dozen documents. It is CHECKED: every in_progress class
must belong to exactly one family, and the generator FAILS if a class appears
that no family claims. A new open class can therefore never be silently dropped
from the count -- the failure this project has hit four separate times.

Usage:  python3 tools/status_board.py [--check]
        --check exits non-zero if the committed board is out of date.

#   "proposed" WRITTEN UP BY CLAUDE WITH EVIDENCE, NOT YET REVIEWED. This is NOT
#              a decision and must never be counted as one.
#   "open"     nobody has proposed anything yet.
#
# An earlier version had only two states, so attaching a document to a family
# silently promoted it to "decided" -- and five families Claude wrote up alone
# were reported to the team as settled. A status board that launders a proposal
# into a decision is worse than no board.
